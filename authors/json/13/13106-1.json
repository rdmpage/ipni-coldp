{"alternativeNames":"","comments":"This record has the same dates as Jens Holmboe.  It originated from Fl. Europaea where there was no forename just initial ‘T’.  The original APN compilers added  ‘Theodor’.  They may have been confused by the fact that Herman Theodor Holm (1854-1932) published as Theodor or Theo Holm, but he published mostly on American plants.","dates":"1880-1943","forename":"Theodor","fqId":"urn:lsid:ipni.org:authors:13106-1","id":"13106-1","isoCountries":"","recordType":"author","source":"Flora Europaea; Updates from R.W.
